# UX/UI DESIGN - INTERVIEW

Interviewee- Valeriya

Interviewer- Inna

⁃ Hello! What's your name? Tell me a little about yourself.

My name is Valeria, I came from Ukraine. I am studying at the wonderful HYF
school. I hope to become a programmer. I have pets and I love animals very much.

⁃ What will your website be about?

I want to make a website that will become a volunteer platform.Many peoples want
to help Ukraine and its residents directly, but do not know how to do it and are
also afraid of getting caught by scammers. My platform will feature various
organizations with their descriptions and the stories of those they help. Direct
ones will be presented so that donations can be made without intermediaries.

⁃ Which organizations will be represented?

Very different. But all of them can be divided into three groups - assistance to
the military and their families, assistance to ordinary people and assistance to
animals.

⁃ Will there be images on the main page of your website?

Yes. I would like to make a background image in the header area and an image for
each of the categories.

⁃ What colors would you like to use?

Elements and background images should contain yellow-blue shades. The rest of
the page should have muted natural tones that would not distract and it should
contrast with the text and image.

⁃ What should be the font?

Restrained, without unnecessary details, well readable.

⁃ What language will the website be in?

Ideally, it should contain English, Ukrainian, Dutch and French versions but
let's start with English and Ukrainian.

⁃ Would you like your logo, information about you, and/or your contacts to be
present?

I don't have a logo, so information about me will be superfluous but you can
leave contacts for feedback and suggestions about the site.
